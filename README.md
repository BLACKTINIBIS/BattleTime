It's Battle Time! 

Pick a name, pick your stats, and fight an infinite number of enemies on your way to glory!
I recommend picking high health and strength, but you do you. Food and health are restored 
at the end of every battle at a maximum of your Max Health stat, and 30 food. 

Each fight is turn based, so you go and the enemy goes immediately after.

Attacking:
  You roll with advantage with a virtual die that is the same value as your Strength stat.
  This is multiplied * 2/3. You lose half the amount of your attack damage from your stamina.

Resting:
  You roll a D6, and restore that amount to your health AND your stamina.

Healing:
  You roll a D10, and restore that amount to your health.

Eating:
  You roll a D10, and restore that amount to your health, and lose 5 food.

If you win the battle, you get XP, add 1 to your victories and move on to the next fight.

Leveling Up:
  You level up when you have 25 times your current level in XP. Players start at lvl 6.

That's about it! Have fun!

Why make this?
  It started as a comment on the current chapter of my intro to programming class, and got
  way out of control. So I split it up into different files, and made it it's own repo.
